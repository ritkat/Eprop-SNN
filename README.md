The provided source files contain the PyTorch-based code for training spiking recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with the eligibility propagation (e-prop) algorithm, as per the original paper:

This code demonstrates e-prop on the cue accumulation task described in the e-prop paper by Bellec et al. The e-prop implementation provided here only covers the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model, which is presented by Bellec et al. as not able to learn the second-long time dependencies of the cue accumulation task. We solve this issue by using a second-long leakage time constant. We introduce this technique in the following paper:

Instructions on how to use the code are available in the [main.py](main.py) source file. Parts of the code linked to dataset generation and network visualization were adapted from the original TensorFlow e-prop implemation from TU Graz, available [here](https://github.com/IGITUGraz/eligibility_propagation).
