 "main.py" - Main file for training a spiking RNN with eligibility propagation (e-prop), as per the original paper:

        [G. Bellec et al., "A solution to the learning dilemma for recurrent networks of spiking neurons,"
         Nature communications, vol. 11, no. 3625, 2020]

    This code demonstrates e-prop on the cue accumulation task described in the e-prop paper by Bellec et al. The 
    e-prop implementation provided here only covers the LIF neuron model, which is presented by Bellec et al. as not
    able to learn the second-long time dependencies of the cue accumulation task.
    We solve this issue by using a second-long leakage time constant. We introduce this technique in the following paper:

        [C. Frenkel and G. Indiveri, "ReckOn: A 28nm sub-mmÂ² task-agnostic spiking recurrent neural network
         processor enabling on-chip learning over second-long timescales," IEEE International Solid-State
         Circuits Conference (ISSCC), 2022]

    Example run: default parameters contained in this file provide suitable convergence for the cue accumulation task
             described in the e-prop paper. The code can just be ran with "python main.py"
